BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
CC :
Atypical CP 54 yo smoker , hx of hyperlipidemia , htn , DM , TAH / BSO age 48 , and hx of atypical cp .
She presented in 1999 and stress-ECHO , she exercised 9.5 min without pain , ECHO was nl with no wall motional abn , but EKG showed 1mm ST depressions .
In 2001 , she again p / w CP and ETT again showed 1mm ST depression , exercised 9min .
On 5/23/03 , pt p / w worsening R leg "" heat "" x 2 days , no difficulty ambulating , min pain .
While waiting for LENI 's in ED , she developed CP , similar to old pain , in low sub-sternal area radiating to left shoulder , no EKG changes .
An ETT was done--pt exercised 9.5 min and there was 2mm ST depression inferiorly and laterally where persisted for 10 minutes during rest .
Enzymes flat .
*** Initial Plan *** ***
CV isch :
Pt has sig risk factors for CAD .
But given no symptoms during exercise x 9.5 min and neg enzymes after exercise , CP is likely not CAD .
However , she is still at high risk for CAD .
Will plan for Cath on 5/24 .
Cont ASA , Lopressor , Zocor .
*** Vasc :
LENI 's to rule out DVT of R leg
*** Endo :
CZI sliding scale .
*** Hosp course ***
Enzymes were flat x3 and pt was ruled out for MI .
A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed clean coronary arteries .
Therefore , she pain was not cardiac .
It is important to note in the future that she physiologically develops 1-2 mm ST depressions during ETT and she reports no pain during ETT .
She should have Stress MIBI or Stress ECHO if there is suspicion of CAD in to future .
Lower extremitiy non-invasives were performed for the R leg "" heat "" which were negative .
