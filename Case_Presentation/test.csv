HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection .
The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 .
In December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke 's grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .
She received postoperative chemotherapy .
In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .
The exploratory laparotomy was negative .
She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .
In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .
In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .
She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .
She also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction in 1983 , hypothyroidism , history of breast cancer and history of colon cancer .

This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology .
The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely .
She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion .
This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation .
This additional chest tube was removed the following day .
Her postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 .
Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable .
Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three .

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE :
On July 27 , 2006 , Ms. Straight underwent pelviscopy that was converted to a laparotomy with right salpingo-oophorectomy , lysis of adhesions , right ileal resection with primary reanastomosis and appendectomy .
Please refer to operative report dictation for full details of the operative course .
Briefly , there is noted to be dense adhesions involving the ileum , the appendix , cecum , pelvic cystic mass and the right ovary .
In the course of lysis of adhesions a small enterotomy in ileum was noted .
General surgical consultation was obtained from Dr. Obe who performed lysis of ileal adhesions with another small enterotomy secondary to dense adhesions .
An approximately 3-4 cm segment of the ileum was resected with a primary end to end reanastomosis .
The estimated blood loss was 200 ml .
The final surgical pathology showed a right hemorrhagic cyst of undetermined origin with extensive adhesions , peri-appendiceal adhesions and ileum with adhesions .
Postoperatively , Ms. Straight was maintained with an NG tube and bowel rest until postoperative day #5 when she passed flatus .
Of note , on postoperative day #3 and #4 , she spiked isolated temperatures to 101 .
Evaluation was unrevealing in terms of focal source of her fever .
The urine and blood cultures were negative .
Chest x-ray was negative .
After postoperative day #4 , she experienced no further episodes of fever .
Following her NG tube discontinuation on postoperative day #5 , she experienced three to four episodes of bilious emesis .
On examination , her abdomen was nondistended and she had normal bowel sounds .
A KUB confirmed no evidence of an ileus or obstruction .
She was managed conservatively and kept npo for one night and then her diet was advanced slowly .
By the evening of postoperative day #7 , she was tolerating full house diet and had two spontaneous bowel movements .
It was unclear her etiology of her emesis following NG tube removal although possibly secondary to a subclinical ileus .
It is also a possibility that she had gastroenteritis from her relative who had presented recently to the ED with similar course of low grade fevers , emesis that resolved in short course .
At time of discharge ( postoperative day #8 08/04/06 ) , she was tolerating a house diet .

Head computerized tomography scan on 10/19 : 3 centimeter hyperdensity within the right putamenal area in the right external capsusle consistent with intra-parenchymal hematoma with mild local mass effect and surrounding edema .
No other areas of hemorrhage identified .
Head computerized tomography scan of 10/23 :
the area of hemorrhage the same , slightly more edema and mass effect .
Pulmonary angiogram :
no evidence of pulmonary emboli .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for Mrs. Dua 's cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension .
A magnetic resonance imaging study will be scheduled as an outpatient in three months to rule out a small vascular malformation if responsible for the hemorrhage .
At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient 's young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .
So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. po q.day , Captopril 75 mg. po three times a day , Nifedipine 40 mg. po three times a day .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will followup with Dr. ______________at Omend Hospital and with Dr. Deep at the Barb Memorial Hospital .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gastric carcinoma
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
hypothyroidism following near total thyroidectomy .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
On 1/12/92 near total gastrectomy with retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy , portal node dissection , repair of ventral hernia , and needle jejunostomy tube placement .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
None
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Tikrhalt is an 86 year old female , previously healthy , who presents with a 3 month history of dysphagia .
A subsequent workup including upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal computerized tomography scan suggested the presence of a gastric mass .
Endoscopy with biopsy revealed gastric carcinoma , poorly differentiated , within the body of the stomach along the greater curvature .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. Ko for a possible resection of this carcinoma .
She reports a 10 pound weight loss over the past several months .
She denies any abdominal pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for an appendectomy in the distant past , cholecystectomy in the past , history of of Cesarean section in the past and a history of near total thyroidectomy for nodular goiter in the past .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Her only medication is Thyrolar for her relative hypothyroidism following resection .
There is a question of an allergy to Tylenol .
She denies any history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease or peptic ulcer disease .
Interestingly , she reports that both her mother and father died of stomach carcinoma .
She is a former smoker , and drinks alcohol occasionally .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is an elderly but spry white female in no acute distress .
Her sclera were nonicteric .
Her oropharynx was clear .
Her neck was supple without masses or bruits noted .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her cardiac examination was unremarkable .
Examination of her abdomen revealed a flat nontender abdomen without palpable masses .
There were multiple well healed surgical scars .
She was guaiac negative .
There was no cva tenderness or spinal tenderness noted .
Her pulses were intact throughout .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 139 , potassium 3.7 and BUN of 19 .
Her hematocrit was 37.2 with a white blood count of 6.6 .
Her Bilirubin direct and total were 0.1 and 0.3 respectively .
Her alkaline phosphatase was 134 .
Her electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without acute ischemic changes .
Chest X-Ray was unremarkable .
The assessment at the time of admission was that of an 86 year old female with poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma , admitted for resection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Service of Dr. Fede A. Duhenile .
On 1/12/92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction .
In addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision .
This was repaired .
A needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition .
With regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen .
In addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen .
The remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere , including the liver .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition .
The patient 's postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable .
Her wounds healed well without incident and the needle jejunostomy tube was utilized on the first postoperative day right up until the time of discharge , infusing Vivonex T.E.N.
The patient tolerated this without difficulty .
The patient 's nasogastric tube was removed on the 3rd postoperative day , and with the passage of flatus and good bowel sounds noted , she was started on a liquid diet which was advanced slowly .
She was seen by the dietician and was advised with regard to needing numerous small meals during the day rather than 3 larger meals as she previously was used to .
Her ambulation and mobilization increased gradually and by the time of discharge she was walking in the halls without assistance .
As mentioned , her wounds healed well without incident and the staples were removed on the 10th postoperative day just prior to discharge .
She had some difficulties with confusion in the early postoperative period which were attributable to her advanced age and a sundowning effect .
These problems resolved by the 4th or 5th postoperative day and she remained lucid and alert for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Surgical pathology report was completed prior to discharge which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ulcerating and extending through the wall into the serosa of the stomach .
Metastatic carcinoma was present in 3 of 3 lymph nodes .
The gastric resection margins were free of carcinoma .
The patient was set for discharge on the 11th postoperative day doing well .
On the day prior to discharge she complained of some dysuria , a urine specimen was obtained , which showed numerous white cells consistent with a urinary tract infection .
She was started empirically on Bactrim , while culture and sensitivity results were pending and remained pending at the time of this dictation .
She will be discharged to home and will be seen in follow-up by her regular physicians as well as Dr. Ko .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Bactrim , single strength , one p.o. b.i.d. times 10 days , initiated 9/27/92 , Synthroid 0.1 mg p.o. q.day , Ferrous Gluconate 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day .
She will be seen by Visiting Nurses Association to help with general aspects of daily living as well as adequate diet planning following her gastric resection .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Breunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .
She is referred for progressive angina .
She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .
She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .
In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .
In October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .
She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .
In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .
She had exertional angina at that time .
In November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .
She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .
Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .
She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .
In May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .
She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .
She has had no syncope .
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .
She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .
She is a remote cigarette smoker .
She also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .
She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci
She lives alone .
Her son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .
They live in Ohio .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .
Her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .
Neck veins are not distended .
Respiratory rate 12 .
Carotids :
no bruits .
Lungs were clear .
Cardiac :
1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological examination non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .
Hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .
Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .
She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .
Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .
The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .
The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .
This was considered her culprit lesion .
This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .
In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .
Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .
It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .
She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .
This was intermittent .
The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .
The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .
It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .
Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .
She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .
When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .
Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .
He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .
For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .
On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .
There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .
It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .
She tolerated this well .
Her medications were resumed .
She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
RIGHT BREAST CARCINOMA , STATUS POST HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL RESCUE .
LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
( 1 ) High risk carcinoma of the right breast .
( 2 ) Hypertension .
( 3 ) Hypothyroidism .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. A is a 48-year-old woman , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 1998 .
She was in her usual state of health until May of 1997 , when her right breast was noted to be abnormal on mammography .
Biopsy of this specific area was negative .
Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change .
However , by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .
Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .
An ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .
The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .
She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) .
The final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin .
The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion .
ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase .
DNA content was deployed .
On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma .
Subsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery .
She then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well .
Restaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization .
Leukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .
Therefore , she is being admitted for intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin followed by stem cell rescue .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
( 1 ) Breast cancer as per history of present illness .
( 2 ) Hypertension .

She had a large R-wave in V2 , in V1 but with R less than S. She had an inverted T-wave in lead 3 , otherwise , no Q , ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was a 48-year-old woman with high risk carcinoma of the breast admitted for a STAMP with cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin .
The patient was started on the standard protocol with day 0 being equal to December 1999 .
Her hospital course was , overall , uncomplicated and notable for the following events :
( 1 ) Hematology / Oncology :
The patient became neutropenic on day minus 2 and reached a nadir of white blood count of 0.02 on May 8 .
She had her first neutropenic fever on May 9 , 1999 , and all cultures from blood and urine are negative .
A chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia .
The patient was started on ceftazidime initially for febrile neutropenia , but quickly developed a pleuritic rash .
She was put on piperacillin and gentamicin for enteric antibiotic coverage .
She recovered her count and was no longer neutropenic on May 11 , 1999 , which is day plus 8 .
On day plus 9 , she had a white count of over 10,000 and her antibiotic coverage was discontinued , as was the G-CSF .
During the patient 's stay here , she required platelet transfusions on two days , and received two units of packed red blood cells on May 8 for a hematocrit of 25.7 .
The patient did not have very significant pain issues while in house , though , she did require a short course on a Fentanyl drip for management of throat pain .
She never developed severe oral mucositis that was appreciable , and her oral thrush was treated successfully with fluconazole .
